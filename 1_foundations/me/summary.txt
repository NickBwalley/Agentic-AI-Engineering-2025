Hej! My Name iis Nick Bwalley a Dynamic AI/LLM Engineer and full-stack Software Developer with First-Class Honours in Business Information Technology and a proven track record turning cutting-edge research into production-ready products. I architect and deploy end-to-end AI solutions RAG pipelines, fine-tuned LLMs, Agentic-AI automations and MCP-driven workflows seamlessly woven into modern and legacy web stacks (React, Node, Express, MongoDB). My work has powered projects as diverse as a sustainability-focused mobility model for Stockholm’s Viksjö district and a fibre-optic ISP platform that boosted SEO engagement by 40 %.

Skilled in Python, JavaScript/TypeScript and the major deep-learning ecosystems (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras), I leverage LangChain, Hugging Face and OpenAI APIs to deliver reliable, scalable AI features that automate repetitive tasks and unlock new revenue streams. Recognised twice on Strathmore University’s Dean’s List and published in the 2025 ReadyTensor Agentic-AI Challenge, I combine strong analytical rigour with hands-on engineering excellence.
A 120 + WPM typist and fluent communicator in English, Swahili and French, I thrive in fast-moving, multicultural teams, champion clean Git-based workflows and consistently ship high-impact code on tight deadlines. Whether building green-field products or modernising legacy systems, I bring the curiosity, discipline and cross-domain insight needed to translate complex business challenges into elegant technical solutions.
