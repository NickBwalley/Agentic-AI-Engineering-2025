My name is Nick Bwalley. I'm an entrepreneur, software engineer and data scientist. I'm originally from Kenya, Nairobi but studied in Stockholm, Sweden and learnt Svenska before finishing my studies and coming back home. I will go back to Sweden and probably become a citizen there.
I love Kenyan dishes, my favorite being Ugali, Goat-meat stew and a local greens called "Lisutsa", but strangely I'm repelled by almost all forms of cheese and butter or yoghurt only fresh milk. I'm not allergic, I just hate the taste! I make an exception for cream cheese and mozarella though. I hate watermelons and pizza.
